# China Debt Analysis

This project investigates **China's international lending practices** and the growing discourse around *debt-trap diplomacy*. By analyzing datasets related to Chinese loans to developing nations, we aim to understand the scale, pattern, and impact of China's debt-driven influence on economically vulnerable countries.

The project was completed using **Python** for data analysis, cleaning, and visualization, leveraging tools such as `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `plotly`.

## Project Context

**Debt-trap diplomacy** refers to a scenario where a creditor country (like China) extends excessive credit to a debtor country, with the possible intention of leveraging economic or political control once the debtor struggles to repay. 

While the term is controversial and debated, several high-profile cases (e.g., Sri Lanka’s Hambantota Port lease to China) have triggered global attention, especially from Western analysts and governments.

The objective of this project is to use data to explore and communicate:

- Which countries owe the most to China?
- What sectors or infrastructure types are being financed?
- Are there observable repayment or default trends?
- Which regions are most exposed to Chinese credit?

## About the Dataset

The dataset includes information on:

- Recipient countries
- Year of loan issuance
- Loan amounts (USD)
- Sectors (e.g., transport, energy, telecom)
- Chinese creditors
- Terms of the loan (interest rate, maturity, grace period, etc.)

The data is sourced from **AidData**, research institutions, and open-access financial tracking initiatives.

## Key Analysis Performed

### Exploratory Data Analysis
- Summary statistics of Chinese debt exposure by country and region
- Top sectors financed via Chinese loans
- Trend analysis over years (2000–2021)
- Debt distribution by interest rate and repayment terms

### Geopolitical Visualizations
- Choropleth map of debt concentration by country
- Bar plots and line charts showing annual disbursements
- Bubble charts representing sectoral loan allocation

### Critical Observations
- Identification of countries at higher risk of debt distress
- Examples of strategic infrastructure investments (e.g., ports, energy grids)
- Visual storytelling of China’s expanding global financial footprint
